        <p class="py-2">
          I have to admit I'm a cliché. I started my first VC backed business at 19, where I was the youngest person accepted into <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com" class="link">YC</a> (2008). We built a distributed hotel-chain called <a href="https://www.onefinestay.com" class="link">onefinestay</a> (think complex logistics business, mixed with super high-end brand). We scaled it across 4 countries, until we eventually we sold it for a few hundred million dollars (back before unicorn was
          even a term).
        </p>
        <p class="py-2">More recently I've helped build the <a href="https://www.lis.ac.uk" class="link">London Interdisciplinary School</a>. Which has been dubbed <i class="italic">“The most radical new university to open in decades”</i> by the Times. Where we prepare people for the real world. Full of all it's complexity and uncertainty which seems to be growing uncontrollably.</p>
        <p class="py-2">Right now, I'm continuing on this journey by building <a href="https://www.disco.management" class="link">DISCO</a>. A platform which helps guides professionals to find their unique style and voice. Where we teach soft-skills and practical frameworks, in a no-nonsense, yet empathetic way.</p>

        <h2 class="mb-3 text-4xl tracking-tight text-zing font-serif">Executive coach</h2>
        <p class="py-2">
          Since 2018 I've had the privilege of supporting some extraordinary founders in creating genuine impact. I know how hard, lonely, infuriating, rewarding, exhilarating... the journey is. It's a potent cocktail of feelings you can only truly understand once you've actually tasted it. I was fortunate enough to have some fantastic support and help on my journey. And I love helping people on theirs. As per the businesses I've been drawn to, for better or for worse, the impact I seem to be
          good at creating is helping people do their best work.
        </p>
        <p class="py-2">As a coach, my main job is to give a shit about you and your life. I'm here to help <i class="italic">you</i> make the right decisions when they matter most. I do this by smashing together my practical, hard earned experience as a founder, with the solid theory from developed at LIS and DISCO. I focus on high performance management, that's packed full of love and respect.</p>
        <p class="py-2">Although much of my time is taken up by scaling this impact through DISCO, I really enjoy working with Execs, so if you'd like to work together get in touch <span class="text-zing">tim[at]disco.management</span></p>
        <p class="py-2">I also obviously care deeply about the climate crisis, so if you're a founder doing positive climate work, I'd love to help you pro-bono. So if that's you, please get in touch too!</p>

        <h2 class="mb-3 text-4xl font-serif tracking-tight">Complexity Research</h2>
        <p class="py-2">When we started <a href="https://www.lis.ac.uk" class="link">LIS</a> back in 2018 we outlined 4 complex challenges we knew students would have to answer in their lifetimes. They were: vaccine rollouts in a pandemic, dealing with mass misinformation, supply chain breakdowns and what to do when gene-drives get out of control. Little did we know three of those would engulf the world two years later.</p>
        <p>The climate crisis, the rampantly rising global inequality, the fragility of all our major infrastructures. All of these and all the world's most pressing problems are "complex". They can't be broken down into neat little chunks, they can't be solved in silo's or by arbitrary disciplines. This is by LIS had to be Interdisciplinary, to bridge those gaps.</p>
        <p class="py-2">Complexity is the single most important topic we should be researching. This is why I spend whatever time I have doing fundamental research on new statistical techniques to help us quantify and navigate complex decisions. Then translating them into techniques which can be used by leaders to make real positive change.</p>
